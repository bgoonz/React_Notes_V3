<h1 id="filing-tickets-against-loglevel">Filing tickets against loglevel</h1>
<p>If you’d like to file a bug or a feature request for loglevel, the best option is to <a href="https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/issues/new">open an issue on Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re filing a feature request, please remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature requests significantly expanding the scope of loglevel outside the description in <a href="https://github.com/pimterry/loglevel/blob/master/README.md">the readme</a> will probably be rejected.</li>
<li>Features that can’t be meaningfully implemented in a cross-environment compatible manner won’t be implemented.</li>
<li>Please check the previously opened issues to see if somebody else has suggested it first.</li>
<li>Consider submitting a pull request to add the feature instead, if you’re confident it fits within the above</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re filing a bug, please remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide detailed steps to reproduce the behaviour</li>
<li>If possible, provide a Jasmine test which reproduces the behaviour</li>
<li>Please specify the exact details of the environment in which it fails: OS + Environment (i.e. Browser or Node) + version</li>
<li>Consider submitting a pull request to fix the bug instead</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="helping-develop-loglevel">Helping develop loglevel</h1>
<p>If you’d like to help develop loglevel further, please submit a pull request! I’m very keen to improve loglevel further, and good pull requests will be enthusiastically merged.</p>
<p>Before submitting a pull request to fix a bug or add a new feature, please check the lists above to ensure it’ll be accepted. Browser compatibility is particularly important here; if you add a feature or fix a bug which breaks things on other browsers it will not be merged, no matter how awesome it may be.</p>
<p>To be more specific, before submitting your pull request please ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>You haven’t broken the existing test suite in any obvious browsers (at least check latest IE/FF/Chrome - automatic saucelabs tests for this are coming soon too)</li>
<li>You’ve added relevant tests for the bug you’re fixing/the new feature you’re adding/etc, which pass in all the relevant browsers</li>
<li>JSHint is happy with your new code</li>
<li>You’ve updated the API docs (in README.md) to detail any changes you’ve made to the public interface</li>
<li>Your change is backward compatible (or you’ve explicitly said if it’s not; this isn’t great, but will be considered)</li>
<li>You haven’t changed any files in dist/ (these are auto-generated, and should only be changed on release)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>The core project code is all in lib/loglevel.js, and this should be the only file you need to touch for functional changes themselves.</p>
<p>The released code is in dist/*.js, and should not be touched by anything except releases</p>
<p>The test suite is entirely in test/*.js:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every file ending in ‘-test.js’ is a unit test, is written in RequireJS, and should pass in any environment</li>
<li>global-integration.js and node-integration.js are quick integration smoke tests for node and for browser global usage</li>
<li>test-helpers.js contains some test utilities</li>
<li>manual-test.html is a test page which includes the current loglevel build, so you can manually check it works in a given browser</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-make-your-change-and-submit-it">How to make your change and submit it</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fork loglevel</li>
<li>Clone your fork locally</li>
<li>Create a branch from master for your change</li>
<li>Write some tests in /test for your change, as relevant</li>
<li>Make your code changes in /lib/loglevel.js</li>
<li>Check your code all passes (run <code>grunt</code>) - if you have any issues try running <code>grunt jasmine:requirejs:src:build</code> (or a different test build instead of ‘requirejs’: see the jasmine config in Gruntfile.js) and debugging the generated _SpecRunner.html in a browser</li>
<li>Commit your changes</li>
<li>Open a pull request back to master in loglevel</li>
</ol>
