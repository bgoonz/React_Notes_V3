<p>Since the launch we have received a lot of feedback and are actively working on React 0.4. In the meantime, here are the highlights of this week.</p>
<h2 id="some-quick-thoughts-on-react">Some quick thoughts on React</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewgreig.com/">Andrew Greig</a> made a blog post that gives a high level description of what React is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Facebook’s recently released JavaScript framework called React.js for the last few days and have managed to obtain a rather high level understanding of how it works and formed a good perspective on how it fits in to the entire javascript framework ecosystem.</p>
<p>Basically, React is not an MVC framework. It is not a replacement for Backbone or Knockout or Angular, instead it is designed to work with existing frameworks and help extend their functionality.</p>
<p>It is designed for building big UIs. The type where you have lots of reusable components that are handling events and presenting and changing some backend data. In a traditional MVC app, React fulfils the role of the View. So you would still need to handle the Model and Controller on your own.</p>
<p>I found the best way to utilise React was to pair it with Backbone, with React replacing the Backbone View, or to write your own Model/Data object and have React communicate with that.</p>

<h2 id="react-and-socketio-chat-application">React and Socket.IO Chat Application</h2>
<p><a href="https://danialk.github.io/">Danial Khosravi</a> made a real-time chat application that interacts with the back-end using Socket.IO.</p>
<blockquote>
A week ago I was playing with AngularJS and <a href="https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io-im">this little chat application</a> which uses socket.io and nodejs for realtime communication. Yesterday I saw a post about ReactJS in <a href="http://www.echojs.com/">EchoJS</a> and started playing with this UI library. After playing a bit with React, I decided to write and chat application using React and I used Bran Ford’s Backend for server side of this little app.

<h2 id="react-and-other-frameworks">React and Other Frameworks</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.petehunt.net/blog/">Pete Hunt</a> wrote an answer on Quora comparing React and Angular directives. At the end, he explains how you can make an Angular directive that is in fact being rendered with React.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To set the record straight: React components are far more powerful than Angular templates; they should be compared with Angular’s directives instead. So I took the first Google hit for “AngularJS directive tutorial” (AngularJS Directives Tutorial - Fundoo Solutions), rewrote it in React and compared them. […]</p>
<p>We’ve designed React from the beginning to work well with other libraries. Angular is no exception. Let’s take the original Angular example and use React to implement the fundoo-rating directive.</p>

<p>In the same vein, <a href="https://twitter.com/markov_twain/status/345702941845499906">Markov Twain</a> re-implemented the examples on the front-page <a href="http://jsbin.com/azihiw/2/edit">with Ember</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vla">Vlad Yazhbin</a> re-implemented the tutorial <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/vla/Cdrse/">with Angular</a>.</p>
<h2 id="web-components-react--x-tags">Web Components: React &amp; x-tags</h2>
<p>Mozilla and Google are actively working on Web Components. <a href="http://blog.vjeux.com/">Vjeux</a> wrote a proof of concept that shows how to implement them using React.</p>
<blockquote>
Using <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">x-tags</a> from Mozilla, we can write custom tags within the DOM. This is a great opportunity to be able to write reusable components without being tied to a particular library. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/vjeux/react-xtags/">x-react</a> to have them being rendered in React.

<h2 id="react-todomvc-example">React TodoMVC Example</h2>
<p><a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC.com</a> is a website that collects various implementations of the same basic Todo app. <a href="http://www.petehunt.net/blog/">Pete Hunt</a> wrote an idiomatic React version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV* framework for structuring and organizing their JavaScript web apps.</p>
To help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today.

<h2 id="jsx-is-not-html">JSX is not HTML</h2>
<p>Many of you pointed out differences between JSX and HTML. In order to clear up some confusion, we have added some documentation that covers the four main differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/docs/jsx-is-not-html.html">Whitespace removal</a></li>
<li><a href="/docs/jsx-is-not-html.html">HTML Entities</a></li>
<li><a href="/docs/jsx-is-not-html.html">Comments</a></li>
<li><a href="/docs/jsx-is-not-html.html">Custom HTML Attributes</a></li>
