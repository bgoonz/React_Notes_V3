        Express to serve our application? Wasn’t npm working fine?
        <ul>
          <li>
            Previously, we were serving up our application using the
            <code>npm start</code> script.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the script ran, the files were being streamlined for the
            browser on your computers RAM and not actually saved anywhere
            permanent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>NPM build</code> did the same process, but also created the
            <code>build/</code> directory and saved static files of your
            application into it. We are having express serve these static,
            pre-built files because that is what we would actually push into
            production! The express folder of this second project, which
            contains
            <ul>
              <li>The express server</li>
              <li>The static files of your react application.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When someone visits your webpage, we don’t expect Heroku to run npm
            start, streamline all of those files, then serve those up. We cut
            out the middleman and just hand those streamlined files to Heroku.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
