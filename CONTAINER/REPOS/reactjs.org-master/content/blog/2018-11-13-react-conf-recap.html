<p>Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov kicked off Day 1 with their keynote, React Today and Tomorrow. In the talk, they introduced <a href="/docs/hooks-intro.html">Hooks</a>, which are a new proposal that adds the ability to access features such as state without writing a JavaScript class. Hooks promise to dramatically simplify the code required for React components and are currently available in a React alpha release.</p>

<p>On the morning of Day 2, Andrew Clark and Brian Vaughn presented Concurrent Rendering in React. Andrew covered the recently announced <a href="/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html">React.lazy API for code splitting</a> and previewed two upcoming features: concurrent mode and Suspense. Brian demonstrated how to use <a href="/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html">React’s new profiler</a> tooling to make apps built in React run faster.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Parashuram N spoke in detail about React Native’s New Architecture, a long-term project that the React Native team has been working on over the past year and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018">announced in June</a>. We’re really excited about the potential of this project to improve performance, simplify interoperability with other libraries, and set a strong foundation for the future of React Native.</p>
<p>Now that the conference is over, all 28 conference talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGE5AihOSExAa4wUM-P42EIJ">available to stream online</a>. There are tons of great ones from both days. We can’t wait until next year!</p>
