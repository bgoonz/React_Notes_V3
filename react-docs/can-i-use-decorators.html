</header>
<p>Some popular libraries use <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841">decorators</a> in their documentation.</p>
<p>Create React App intentionally doesn’t support decorator syntax at the moment because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an experimental proposal and is subject to change (in fact, it has already changed once, and will change again).</li>
<li>Most libraries currently support only the old version of the proposal — which will never be a standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>However in many cases you can rewrite decorator-based code without decorators and achieve the same result.</p>
<p>Please refer to these two threads for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/214">#214</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/411">#411</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Create React App will add decorator support when the specification advances to a stable stage.</p>
